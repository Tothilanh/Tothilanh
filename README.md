### WELCOME TO MY PAGE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lanh. I graduated with a major in Marketing from Cantho University in 2017. Currently, I am working as a Data Analyst in a pharmaceutical company. This role has allowed me to blend my marketing knowledge with data analysis techniques to assist not only the Marketing team but also the Sales team in uncovering valuable insights from our data.  My long-term goal is to evolve into a Data Scientist.
